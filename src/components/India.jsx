          One of the oldest civilisations in the world, India is a mosaic of
          multicultural experiences. With a rich heritage and myriad
          attractions, the country is among the most popular tourist
          destinations in the world. It covers an area of 32, 87,263 sq. km,
          extending from the snow-covered Himalayan heights to the tropical rain
          forests of the south. As the 7th largest country in the world, India
          stands apart from the rest of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains
          and the sea, which give the country a distinct geographical entity.
          Fringed by the Great Himalayas in the north, it stretches southwards
          and at the Tropic of Cancer, tapers off into the Indian Ocean between
          the Bay of Bengal on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west. As you
          travel the expanse of the country, you are greeted by diverse nuances
          of cuisines, faiths, arts, crafts, music, nature, lands, tribes,
          history and adventure sports. India has a mesmeric conflation of the
          old and the new. As the bustling old bazaars rub shoulders with swanky
          shopping malls, and majestic monuments accompany luxurious heritage
          hotels, the quintessential traveller can get the best of both worlds.
          Head to the mountains, enjoy a beach retreat or cruise through the
          golden Thar, India has options galore for all.
